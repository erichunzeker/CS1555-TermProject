ER – 
	*How do you store open and close hours in one attribute for station? 
	*Do you need to introduce schedule_id or train and route Id will be enough identifier? 
	*For distance, you might consider distance between start of rail and a particular stop. 
	*Train schedule : Train is N:1. 
	*You need also stations per route. I would say you have route has stop instead of rail has stop. 
	*You need a passenger to book a trip as per train schedule, not train. The booking is required to be done by an employee not by the passenger. You do not consider this in your current design.
	Also, do you consider that the routes have two directions?

SQL – 
	*You can add description attribute in route in order not to have one attribute table.
	Incorporate all the things mentioned for the ER diagram into the SQL
